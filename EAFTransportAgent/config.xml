    <attachments> section
    =====================
    You can whitelist, remove or reject specific attachment file names here.
    Use wildcard syntax (* and ?, such as *.exe, virus*.*, ...).
    If there is both whitelist and remove/reject match, then whitelist has precedence (so it is possible to whitelist remove/reject exceptions).
    If there is both remove and reject match, then reject has precedence.
    If there is any rejected attachment found, then the whole message is rejected (discarded, deleted, no NDR is sent!).
    
    Default list below contains potentially dangerous file extensions, you can modify it to fit your needs. 
    You can simply move <attachment> element between whitelist, remove and reject sections.

  <parameters>
    <!-- 
      mailSizeThreshold
      process email messages with size lower than specified threshold only
      default is 1024 (1024kB = 1MB), 0 = no limit
      
      If email size is greater than this value, no further checks are processed.
      
      Malicious software is usually small in size (only few kB) so you can lower this value to get better 
      performance and to get less false positive detections.
      
      The best value depends on actual malware trends and you should read the logs and experiment a bit.
      
      Do not increase this value too much unless you REALLY KNOW WHAT are you doing and WHY are you doing it! 
      We do in-memory operations with some attachemnts so large attachments may bring your server down to the knees!!!

    <senders> section
    =================
    Uncomment this section below if you want to whitelist specific senders (no filtering will be applied)
    
    Use *@domain.com to accept everything from single domain or you can even play with
    wildcard syntax the same way as with filename wildcards (shares the same syntax)
    
    But do not forget that attackers often spoof sender's address so be careful 
    when whitelisting by sender or even by whole domain(s).
